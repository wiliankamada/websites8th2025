    <h2> What is Anorexia?</h2>
    <p> Have you ever seen someone who's obsessed with weight loss like Tia Ains Worth? Tia faced a eating disorder called anorexia, which makes people lose weight in a unhealthy way, even when they already are underweight, due to cultural body ideals, and a negative self image, not  admitting how intense weight loss may be dangerous, and putting their lives through medication to have less appetite. They tend to cut their food into small pieces so they don't eat, exercise in order to lose weight all the time, overthinking about what they eat, and force themselves to throw up to lose weight (Charlie Buckland, 2025). </p>

    <h2>How the Influence of Social Media Algorithms on Eating Behavior Among Youth?</h2>
    <p>n social media , there are many trends that make people do certain things. However, not all of the trends are always safe, and some may even cause death. One of them is #skinnytok, a # that body shames people into anorexia, promoting extreme thinness, diets and starvation, with a main focus on young women or girls (Kim Willsher, 2025). Some examples of harmful at apps like instagram and tik tok are: replace more caloric foods for less caloric foods (examples: chocolate with carrots), do 30 days challenges (example: 30 days with no carbs), and do the consumption of medicines like laxatives. All of these practices/behaviors make anorexia worse. Skinnytok is part of tiktok’s algorithm that’s driven content stream that promotes extreme thinness and potentially harmful eating habits. It has become a hot spot for videos glamorizing rapid weight loss, “what i eat in a day” pots with dangerously low calorie content, and body comparison clips, often served up automatically by tiktok, a recommendation system. (Sejla Ahmotavic, 2025)</p>
